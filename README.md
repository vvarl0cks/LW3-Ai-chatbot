## 🤖 Building an AI chatbot   

In this lesson, we’re gonna be building a super simple chatbot using openAI’s API. We’re only gonna ask the user for input, feed it to the API, and consume the response it sends back  

## 🏗 Our Stack

We’ll use Nextjs, TypeScript and Tailwind for this project. Make sure you have Nodejs already installed on your device already. If you don’t, download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

We’re gonna be using the latest version of Nextjs, which includes using the App Router. It is quite different from the one you might currently be familiar with.

You also need an OpenAI API key. If you don’t have it, go ahead and get one here https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
